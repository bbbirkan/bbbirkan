## Bridging the Gap Between Asphalt & Algorithms

I drive 18-wheelers and build AI-driven software systems. While others theorize about supply chains, I live them—seeing inefficiencies firsthand from the cab of a truck while engineering solutions with code.

**Currently:** Professional driver at Covenant Logistics | Building toward owner-operator status  
**Company:** Founder, Anvilon LLC  
**Future:** Kalyon.us - Owner-operator transportation venture

### 💡 Philosophy

> "You can't automate what you don't understand."

I reject dogma. Whether analyzing route optimization from a truck cab or debugging a production server at a rest stop, I strip problems down to their fundamental truths using first-principles thinking.

**Approach:**
- Solve real-world problems, not theoretical exercises
- Build systems that work in production, not just demos
- Combine domain expertise with technical execution
- Ship products, measure results, iterate

**Interests:** Critical Thinking • Nuclear Physics • AI Symbiosis • Supply Chain Innovation • Econometrics
