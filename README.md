### 💡 Philosophy
> "You can't automate what you don't understand."

I reject dogma. Whether analyzing route optimization from a truck cab or debugging a production server at a rest stop, I strip problems down to their fundamental truths using first-principles thinking.

**Approach:**
- Solve real-world problems, not theoretical exercises
- Build systems that work in production, not just demos
- Combine domain expertise with technical execution
- Ship products, measure results, iterate

**Interests:** Critical Thinking • Nuclear Physics • AI Symbiosis • Supply Chain Innovation • Econometrics • Algorithmic Trading
